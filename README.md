# 📖 Project Information
Node Farms is a minimalist backend application developed using Node.js core modules to dynamically manage a farm product catalog.

This project is designed to introduce you to the Node.js ecosystem and gain proficiency in topics such as setting up an HTTP server, managing a file system (FS), and basic page routing.

# ✨ Application Specifications
This project focuses on the core Node.js modules and demonstrates the following backend capabilities:

Native HTTP Server: The application builds a server from scratch with the Node.js HTTP module without using an external library like Express.

Basic Routing: Routing logic is implemented within the Node.js core framework to respond to user requests (e.g., /, /product, /api).

FS Module Usage: Product data is read asynchronously from local JSON files using the fs (File System) module.

Template Rendering: HTML templates are populated with read data to create dynamic web pages (using Custom templating or string replacement).

API Endpoint: There is a special /api endpoint that returns raw product data.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
